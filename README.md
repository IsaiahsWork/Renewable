üîç Quantitative Analysis of Renewable Energy Stocks: A 2025 Market Snapshot
As part of my ongoing work in financial data analysis, I recently conducted a focused study of select U.S. renewable energy stocks using Python and historical price data. The objective was to explore price trends, visualize movements, and lay the groundwork for future portfolio construction using quantitative methods like moving averages.

üß™ Methodology
Using the yfinance API, I extracted daily stock data from January 1 to July 1, 2025 for five notable companies across key clean energy sub-sectors:

Sunrun Inc. (RUN) ‚Äì Residential solar installations

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) ‚Äì Solar microinverters and storage

ChargePoint Holdings Inc. (CHPT) ‚Äì EV charging infrastructure

Generac Holdings Inc. (GNRC) ‚Äì Backup power and grid solutions

SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) ‚Äì Solar inverters and energy optimization

With Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and numpy, I pulled and visualized their "Open" prices, aligning them for comparative analysis over the six-month timeframe.

üìà Key Observations
High Volatility Across the Board: All five stocks demonstrated significant price fluctuations‚Äîa trait consistent with emerging technology and growth sectors.

Differing Correlation Patterns: While all operate in renewable energy, companies like Enphase (ENPH) and SolarEdge (SEDG) showed movement patterns distinct from EV-focused ChargePoint (CHPT), suggesting diversification opportunities even within the sector.

Performance Divergence: The opening prices indicated divergence in investor sentiment. Some stocks rebounded after Q1, while others showed continued downward pressure‚Äîhighlighting the importance of selective positioning.

üß† Takeaways
Thematic investing in clean energy remains promising, but careful security selection is critical due to high volatility and sector-specific headwinds.

Quantitative methods, including trend analysis and moving averages, are invaluable for timing entries and exits in such fast-moving markets.

Data skills + domain knowledge = an edge in modern portfolio construction.
